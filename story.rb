Olaf the dog didnt get out of the house much, mainly due to his owners lazyness.  So as you could imagine walking olaf was difficult.  But then, his owners had all the time in the world to focus on Olaf, and slowly by slowly he became better on his walks, he didnt bark as much and didnt want to fight every dog he encountered.
